AI-Playground is an interactive page that describes Harshad's portfolio and offers several AI project demos. Each project is created as a part of a course, an internship, or a hobby.
Visitors can experiment with several AI models and read the models' source codes. You are welcome to fork any repository if you liked playing.

PS: Some models may take longer time to load as they are hosted on a low-band server using Docker.
